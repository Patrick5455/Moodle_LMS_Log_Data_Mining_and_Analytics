If done well it could be used to balance o the foods that are produced so that we don't have a surplus of one type and a deficiency in all others.It could also be used to predict the best times to grow in a more accurate way and even inform&nbsp; storage and preservation or value addition practices in the field. <br></p><p>Also, it could be used by regional traders to predict when its best to travel, what time, what route and best mode of travel to use.
